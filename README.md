## Go Swiftly - Comparing Apple's Swift & Google's Go

Language: English

### Abstract

Apple's Swift and Google's Go have much in common.

Both were created at leading tech companies in the last 10
years in an attempt to provide a simple, modern, and fast
general-purpose programming language.

Both are published under open source licenses and are
developed on GitHub.

And both now aim to support cross-platform development, as
Swift's December 2015 announcement of Linux support opens
the door to many new possibilities.

Given these similarities, when and why might you choose one
over the other?  Through code examples, this talk will
explore the design goals, strengths and weaknesses of both
languages, and will discuss when each language could be the
right tool for the job.
